# Course-Schedualing-App
This app like most I have is an R app using the shinydashboard interface. This app is used to as a
scheduling tool to view what courses within a college have low enrollments. This is helpful in 
determining what classes are no good at that time slot and if another section need to be added to 
an already impacted class.

Overall this is another good example as to what the plotly library can provide. I was very skeptical
at using a heat map to depict a calendar but it seemed appropriate in the way I approached it. I know
heat maps are not somethign widely used everyday (well at least not in my experience) but if you
like my setup you are wellcome to use it. On the left is a screenshot of the app.</br></br>

<strong><i> Note: the code is up but will not run on R studio because it needs immediate access to a server for the school
I work for. For security resons, this server is not accessible. A link to the app will be posted soon... </i></strong>
